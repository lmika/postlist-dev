# Postlist for Micro.blog

A Micro.blog plugin for adding a shortcode for displaying a dynamic list of posts, similar to [Bear Blog's post macro](https://docs.bearblog.dev/embedding-blog-post-lists/).

## Installing

To install on your Micro.blog site, go to the plugin directory and search for "postlist".

Once installed, you can add a post list to your site by using the `postlist` short-code:

```
{{< postlist >}}
```

See [the usage guide](https://postlist.micro.blog/) for how you can customise this post list, including filtering to posts matching a given category, or changing the sort order.
